# BigMart-Sale-Prediction
Exciting News! Introducing My Latest Project: BigMart Sales Prediction 🚀

Hello LinkedIn Family!
I’m thrilled to share my latest data Analyst project—BigMart Sales Prediction—where I applied Python to analyze and predict sales trends using an innovative approach! 📊

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:
Data Collection & Cleaning:
Sourced the data from GitHub, handled missing values using mean and mode, and streamlined the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Leveraged two amazing libraries:

Dtale: Simplified EDA with interactive visualizations, making it easier to generate insights and explore heatmaps.
Klib: Enhanced EDA through histograms, distribution plots, data cleaning, and even datatype conversions—all in seconds!
Data Preprocessing:
Encoded categorical data, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and standardized the data for model training.

Model Development:
Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest for prediction, achieving satisfactory accuracy.

✨ Key Learnings:
This project gave me hands-on experience with Dtale and Klib, which significantly accelerated the EDA process and improved my overall workflow. These tools are a must-try for any data enthusiast looking to streamline their projects!
